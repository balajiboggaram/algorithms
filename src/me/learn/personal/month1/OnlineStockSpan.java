 * Title 901 : Write a class StockSpanner which collects daily price quotes for
 * some stock, and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.
 * 
 * The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of
 * consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the
 * price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.
 * 
 * For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100, 80, 60,
 * 70, 60, 75, 85], then the stock spans would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].
